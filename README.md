# AiTravelPlanner

1. Used Pandas for reading and manipulating CSV file containing flight data.
2. Implemented Bellman-Ford Algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a starting airport to all other airports. Metric to minimize can be distance or 3. Implemented A* Algorithm instead of Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path. A* can be an effective AI-based algorithm to find the shortest path with a good heuristic function.
4. Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm as another alternative to Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path, but only works for positive-weighted graphs.
